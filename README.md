# City optimizer for Crown of the Gods


Crown of the Gods is an MMORTS empire builder browsergame. It is excellent fun. If you don't play it yet, you should etc etc etc.

(Some UI inspiration has been taken from Hexist's city optimizer, however ALL code on this project is my own and written from scratch in javascript)

My javascript is intentionally left unobfuscated, so that other users can take this code and build on from it, if they want to. (This is also the reason I've linked my github repo above)

If you are building on from this code, it would be nice if you forked it on github so I can see it, but ofc you don't have to :)
